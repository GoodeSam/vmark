/**
 * EditorArea — composes the editor pane, bottom-bar mux, and optional
 * side/bottom panel (terminal today; Assistant pane tomorrow).
 *
 * Per ADR-007, EditorArea is a pure layout helper — no store imports.
 * The dynamic panel positioning (top/bottom/left/right) is the only layout
 * intelligence: left/right use a row axis, top/left draw the panel before
 * the editor. Everything else is pass-through composition.
 *
 * The panel always occupies ONE child slot, after the editor column; top/left
 * reverse the flex axis instead of moving it. Moving it between slots made
 * React unmount and remount it on every top↔bottom / left↔right swap, and the
 * terminal's unmount kills its PTYs — a running Claude session died with it.
 * The cost is that for top/left the DOM (and so Tab) order puts the panel after
 * the editor while it is drawn before; the two are independent landmarks, so
 * no reading sequence depends on that order.
 *
 * The editor + bottom-bar are siblings inside a flex column so the
 * 40px bottom bar always hugs the editor. The panel arranges around
 * that column based on panelPosition.
 *
 * The `main` ARIA landmark wraps only the editor (not the bottom bar) so
 * StatusBar's `contentinfo` landmark stays a top-level sibling.
